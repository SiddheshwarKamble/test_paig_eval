# Welcome to PAIG

**PAIG** (Pronounced similar to *paige* or *payj*) is an open-source project designed to protect Generative AI (GenAI)
applications by ensuring security, safety, and observability. As the technologies and approaches for writing GenAI
applications evolve rapidly, PAIG offers a versatile framework that addresses the latest security and safety challenges
and enables the integration of point security and safety solutions without requiring applications to be rewritten.
